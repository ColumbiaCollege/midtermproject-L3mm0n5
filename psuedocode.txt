Psuedocode for Caleb's Frogger insipred "game"
note: psuedocode written in Notepad++, highly recommend using that to view this document (and all .txt's honestly, I'll never view a readme the same way again) for most pleasant reading experience

Set variables:
	booleans: (all false)
		right
		left
		up
		down
	image:
		vehicle (car)
	integer:
		gamestate
Set memory for frog and cars' objects
	Frog 
	Car
	Cars (multiple cars)
Setup:
	set image mode to center (just in case)
	size: 500 by 1000
	background color: light green
	load image for car
	
	initialize frog and cars
		new frog object
		new car object on row 1 and temporary x position 200
		new cars object: make 100 cars
		use for loop to spread cars out
	set gamestate to 0, the main gameplay mode
Draw:
	make switch for gamestate mode to allow for switching between main gameplay mode and gameover mode
	
	Main gameplay mode (case 0)
		set background to prevent moving objects from bleeding
		add instructions at the top of the screen
		use frog and car class methods (a display and move method from each class)
		add a background colored rectangle at the top to cover extra cars
		set the movement booleans (left,roght,up,down) to false to make frog stop moving when not pressing an arrow key
		check for collision
	
	Gameover mode(case 1)
		background colored rectangle to cover instructions
		gameover text in the middle of screen
		use noLoop to freeze all objects where they are
Key Released method
	when arrow keys are released, move frog in specified direction (up,down,left or right)
create Check Collision method using the radius based distance method

*new tab*

Car class
	set variables
		float
			x position
			y position
			previous x position
	constructor
		expect integer variables for temp car row and temp x position
		resize vehicle image to better match frog image size
		set y position to 100 times temp car row
		set x position to random value to spread cars out 
	display method
		center and display car image at x position and y position
	move method
		move cars constantly leftward and loop back around

*new tab*
	set variables
		integer for direction state
	
Frog class
	set variables
		floats for x position, y position, previous x position and previous y position (all set to 0)
		images for each of the four frog directions (up, down, left, & right)
	constructor
		load the four frog images (one for each cardinal direction)
		set initial position near the bottom of the screen
		set previous x position to equal x position
		set previous y position to equal y position
	move method
		set previous x position to equal x position
		set previous y position to equal y position
		if a direction input boolean is set to true (by pressing appropriate arrow key), move frog in designated direction by a set number of pixels to create gridlike movement and set the directions integer to a number between zero and 3, depending on which direction the frog is moved. one value for each direction
	display method
		using the direction integer, set the frog image to its matching direction (0 for up, 1 for right, 2 for down, and 3 for left)
	dies method
		when frog dies, change to gameover gamestate
